\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the ANOVA model similar to
\code{\link{aov}} (for \code{aov_car} or similar to \code{lme4:lmer} for
\code{aov_4}). Must include an error term (i.e., \code{Error(id/...)} for
\code{aov_car} or \code{(...|id)} for \code{aov_4}). Note that the
within-subject factors do not need to be outside the Error term (this
contrasts with \code{aov}). See Details.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} containing the data. Mandatory.}

\item{fun_aggregate}{The function for aggregating the data before running the
ANOVA if there is more than one observation per individual and cell of the
design. The default \code{NULL} issues a warning if aggregation is
necessary and uses \code{\link{mean}}. Pass \code{mean} directly to avoid
the warning.}

\item{type}{The type of sums of squares for the ANOVA. The default is given
by \code{afex_options("type")}, which is \strong{initially set to 3}.
Passed to \code{\link[car]{Anova}}. Possible values are \code{"II"},
\code{"III"}, \code{2}, or \code{3}.}

\item{factorize}{logical. Should between subject factors be factorized (with
note) before running the analysis. The default is given by
\code{afex_options("factorize")}, which is initially \code{TRUE}. If one
wants to run an ANCOVA, this needs to be set to \code{FALSE} (in which case
centering on 0 is checked on numeric variables).}

\item{check_contrasts}{\code{logical}. Should contrasts for between-subject
factors be checked and (if necessary) changed to be \code{"contr.sum"}. See
details. The default is given by \code{afex_options("check_contrasts")},
which is initially \code{TRUE}.}

\item{observed}{\code{character} vector indicating which of the variables are
observed (i.e, measured) as compared to experimentally manipulated. The
default effect size reported (generalized eta-squared) requires correct
specification of the obsered (in contrast to manipulated) variables.}

\item{anova_table}{\code{list} of further arguments passed to function
producing the ANOVA table.  Arguments such as \code{es} (effect size) or
\code{correction}  are passed to either \code{anova.afex_aov} or
\code{nice}. Note that those settings can also be changed once an object of
class \code{afex_aov} is created by invoking the \code{anova} method
directly.}

\item{include_aov}{Boolean. Allows suppressing the calculation of the aov
object, which is per default part of the returned \code{afex_aov} object.
\code{FALSE} prevents this potentially costly calculation. Especially for
designs with larger N and within-subjects factors, this is highly
advisable. Follow-up analyses using \pkg{emmeans} are then always based on
the multivariate or \code{lm} model.}

\item{return}{What should be returned? The default is given by
\code{afex_options("return_aov")}, which is initially \code{"afex_aov"},
returning an S3 object of class \code{afex_aov} for which various
\link[=afex_aov-methods]{methods} exist (see there and below for more
details). Other values are currently still supported for backward
compatibility.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{fun_aggregate}.}

\item{print.formula}{\code{aov_ez} and \code{aov_4} are wrapper for
\code{aov_car}. This boolean argument indicates whether the formula in the
call to \code{car.aov} should be printed.}

\item{id}{\code{character} vector (of length 1) indicating the subject
identifier column in \code{data}.}

\item{dv}{\code{character} vector (of length 1) indicating the column
containing the \strong{dependent variable} in \code{data}.}

\item{between}{\code{character} vector indicating the
\strong{between}-subject(s) factor(s)/column(s) in \code{data}. Default is
\code{NULL} indicating no between-subjects factors.}

\item{within}{\code{character} vector indicating the
\strong{within}-subject(s)(or repeated-measures) factor(s)/column(s) in
\code{data}.  Default is \code{NULL} indicating no within-subjects factors.}

\item{covariate}{\code{character} vector indicating the between-subject(s)
covariate(s) (i.e., column(s)) in \code{data}. Default is \code{NULL}
indicating no covariates. Please note that \code{factorize} needs to be set
to \code{FALSE} in case the covariate is numeric and should be treated as
such.}

\item{transformation}{In \code{aov_ez}, a \code{character} vector (of length 
1) indicating the name of a transformation to apply to \code{dv} before 
fitting the model. If missing, no transformation is applied. In 
\code{aov_car} and \code{aov_4}, a response transformation may be 
incorporated in the left-hand side of \code{formula}.}
}
\value{
\code{aov_car}, \code{aov_4}, and \code{aov_ez} are wrappers for
  \code{\link[car]{Anova}} and \code{\link{aov}}, the return value is
  dependent on the \code{return} argument. Per default, an S3 object of class
  \code{"afex_aov"} is returned containing the following slots:

\describe{
  \item{\code{"anova_table"}}{An ANOVA table of class \code{c("anova",
   "data.frame")}.}
  \item{\code{"aov"}}{\code{aov} object returned from \code{\link{aov}} 
   (should not be used to evaluate significance of effects, but can be passed 
   to \code{emmeans} for post-hoc tests).}
  \item{\code{"Anova"}}{object returned from \code{\link[car]{Anova}}, an 
  object of class \code{"Anova.mlm"} (if within-subjects factors are present)
  or of class \code{c("anova", "data.frame")}.}
  \item{\code{"lm"}}{the object fitted with \code{lm} and passed to
   \code{Anova} (i.e., an object of class \code{"lm"} or \code{"mlm"}). Also
   returned if \code{return = "lm"}.}
  \item{\code{"data"}}{a list containing: (1) \code{long} (the possibly
   aggregated data in long format used for \code{aov}), \code{wide} (the data
   used to fit the \code{lm} object), and \code{idata} (if within-subject
   factors are present, the \code{idata} argument passed to
  \code{car::Anova}). Also returned if \code{return = "data"}.}
}
In addition, the object has the following attributes: \code{"dv"},
\code{"id"}, \code{"within"}, \code{"between"}, and \code{"type"}.

The \link[=afex_aov-methods]{print} method for \code{afex_aov} objects
(invisibly) returns (and prints) the same as if \code{return} is
\code{"nice"}: a nice ANOVA table (produced by \code{\link{nice}}) with the
following columns: \code{Effect}, \code{df}, \code{MSE} (mean-squared
errors), \code{F} (potentially with significant symbols), \code{ges}
(generalized eta-squared), \code{p}.
}
\description{
These functions allow convenient specification of any type of ANOVAs (i.e.,
purely within-subjects ANOVAs, purely between-subjects ANOVAs, and mixed
between-within or split-plot ANOVAs) for data in the \strong{long} format
(i.e., one observation per row). If the data has more than one observation
per individual and cell of the design (e.g., multiple responses per
condition), the data will by automatically aggregated. The default settings
reproduce results from commercial statistical packages such as SPSS or SAS.
\code{aov_ez} is called specifying the factors as character vectors,
\code{aov_car} is called using a formula similar to \code{\link{aov}}
specifying an error strata for the within-subject factor(s), and \code{aov_4}
is called with a \pkg{lme4}-like formula (all ANOVA functions return
identical results). The returned object contains the ANOVA also fitted via
base R's \code{\link{aov}} which can be passed to e.g., \pkg{emmeans} for
further analysis (e.g., follow-up tests, contrasts, plotting, etc.). These
functions employ \code{\link[car]{Anova}} (from the \pkg{car} package) to
provide test of effects avoiding the somewhat unhandy format of
\code{car::Anova}.
}
\details{
\subsection{Details of ANOVA Specification}{ \code{aov_ez} will concatenate
all between-subject factors using \code{*} (i.e., producing all main effects
and interactions) and all covariates by \code{+} (i.e., adding only the main
effects to the existing between-subject factors). The within-subject factors
do fully interact with all between-subject factors and covariates. This is
essentially identical to the behavior of SPSS's \code{glm} function.

The \code{formula}s for \code{aov_car} or \code{aov_4} must contain a single
\code{Error} term specifying the \code{ID} column and potential
within-subject factors (you can use \code{\link{mixed}} for running
mixed-effects models with multiple error terms). Factors outside the
\code{Error} term are treated as between-subject factors (the within-subject
factors specified in the \code{Error} term are ignored outside the
\code{Error} term; in other words, it is not necessary to specify them
outside the \code{Error} term, see Examples).\cr Suppressing the intercept
(i.e, via \code{0 +} or \code{- 1}) is ignored. Specific specifications of
effects (e.g., excluding terms with \code{-} or using \code{^}) could be okay
but is not tested. Using the \code{\link{I}} or \code{\link{poly}} function
within the formula is not tested and not supported!

To run an ANCOVA you need to set \code{factorize = FALSE} and make sure that
all variables have the correct type (i.e., factors are factors and numeric
variables are numeric and centered).

Note that the default behavior is to include calculation of the effect size
generalized eta-squared for which \strong{all non-manipluated (i.e.,
observed)} variables need to be specified via the \code{observed} argument to
obtain correct results. When changing the effect size to \code{"pes"}
(partial eta-squared) or \code{"none"} via \code{anova_table} this becomes
unnecessary.

If \code{check_contrasts = TRUE}, contrasts will be set to \code{"contr.sum"}
for all between-subject factors if default contrasts are not equal to
\code{"contr.sum"} or \code{attrib(factor, "contrasts") != "contr.sum"}.
(within-subject factors are hard-coded \code{"contr.sum"}.) }

\subsection{Statistical Issues}{ \strong{Type 3 sums of squares are default
in \pkg{afex}.} While some authors argue that so-called type 3 sums of
squares are dangerous and/or problematic (most notably Venables, 2000), they
are the default in many commercial statistical application such as SPSS or
SAS. Furthermore, statisticians with an applied perspective recommend type 3
tests (e.g., Maxwell and Delaney, 2004). Consequently, they are the default
for the ANOVA functions described here. For some more discussion on this
issue see \href{http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/6208/442}{here}.

Note that lower order effects (e.g., main effects) in type 3 ANOVAs are only
meaningful with
\href{http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/effect.htm}{effects
coding}. That is, contrasts should be set to \code{\link{contr.sum}} to
obtain meaningful results. This is imposed automatically for the functions
discussed here as long as \code{check_contrasts} is \code{TRUE} (the
default). I nevertheless recommend to set the contrasts globally to
\code{contr.sum} via running \code{\link{set_sum_contrasts}}. For a
discussion of the other (non-recommended) coding schemes see
\href{http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/library/contrast_coding.htm}{here}. }

\subsection{Follow-Up Contrasts and Post-Hoc Tests}{ The S3 object returned
per default can be directly passed to \code{emmeans::emmeans} for further
analysis. This allows to test any type of contrasts that might be of interest
independent of whether or not this contrast involves between-subject
variables, within-subject variables, or a combination thereof. The general
procedure to run those contrasts is the following (see Examples for a full
example):

 \enumerate{
   \item Estimate an \code{afex_aov} object with the function returned here. For example: \code{x <- aov_car(dv ~ a*b + (id/c), d)}
   \item Obtain a \code{\link[emmeans]{emmGrid-class}} object by running \code{\link[emmeans]{emmeans}} on the \code{afex_aov} object from step 1 using the factors involved in the contrast. For example: \code{r <- emmeans(x, ~a:c)}
   \item Create a list containing the desired contrasts on the reference grid object from step 2. For example: \code{con1 <- list(a_x = c(-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0), b_x = c(0, 0, -0.5, -0.5, 0, 1))}
   \item Test the contrast on the reference grid using \code{\link[emmeans]{contrast}}. For example: \code{contrast(r, con1)}
   \item To control for multiple testing p-value adjustments can be specified. For example the Bonferroni-Holm correction: \code{contrast(r, con1, adjust = "holm")}
 }
 
 Note that \pkg{emmeans} allows for a variety of advanced settings and
 simplifiations, for example: all pairwise comparison of a single factor
 using one command (e.g., \code{emmeans(x, "a", contr = "pairwise")}) or
 advanced control for multiple testing by passing objects to \pkg{multcomp}.
 A comprehensive overview of the functionality is provided in the
 accompanying vignettes (see
 \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emmeans}{here}).
 
 A caveat regarding the use of \pkg{emmeans} concerns the assumption of
 sphericity for ANOVAs including within-subjects/repeated-measures factors
 (with more than two levels). The current default for follow-up tests uses a
 univariate model (\code{model = "univariate"} in the call to
 \code{emmeans}), which does not adequately control for violations of
 sphericity. This may result in anti-conservative tests and contrasts
 somewhat with the default ANOVA table which reports results based on the
 Greenhousse-Geisser correction. An alternative is to use a multivariate
 model (\code{model = "multivariate"} in the call to \code{emmeans}) which
 should handle violations of sphericity better. The default will likely
 change to multivariate tests in one of the next versions of the package.
 
 Starting with \pkg{afex} version 0.22, \pkg{emmeans} is \emph{not}
 loaded/attached automatically when loading \pkg{afex}. Therefore,
 \pkg{emmeans} now needs to be loaded by the user via
 \code{library("emmeans")} or \code{require("emmeans")}.
}  

\subsection{Methods for \code{afex_aov} Objects}{ A full overview over the
methods provided for \code{afex_aov} objects is provided in the corresponding
help page: \code{\link{afex_aov-methods}}. The probably most important ones
for end-users are \code{summary}, \code{anova}, and \code{\link{nice}}.

The \code{summary} method returns, for ANOVAs containing within-subject
(repeated-measures) factors with more than two levels, the complete
univariate analysis: Results without df-correction, the Greenhouse-Geisser
corrected results, the Hyunh-Feldt corrected results, and the results of the
Mauchly test for sphericity.

The \code{anova} method returns a \code{data.frame} of class \code{"anova"}
containing the ANOVA table in numeric form (i.e., the one in slot
\code{anova_table} of a \code{afex_aov}). This method has arguments such as
\code{correction} and \code{es} and can be used to obtain an ANOVA table with
different correction than the one initially specified.

The \code{\link{nice}} method also returns a \code{data.frame}, but rounds
most values and transforms them into characters for nice printing. Also has
arguments like \code{correction} and \code{es} which can be used to obtain an
ANOVA table with different correction than the one initially specified. }
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{aov_4}: Allows definition of ANOVA-model using
\code{lme4::lmer}-like Syntax (but still fits a standard ANOVA).

\item \code{aov_ez}: Allows definition of ANOVA-model using character strings.
}}

\note{
Calculation of ANOVA models via \code{aov} (which is done per default)
  can be comparatively slow and produce comparatively large objects for
  ANOVAs with many within-subjects factors or levels. To avoid this
  calculation set \code{include_aov = FALSE}. You can also disable this
  globally with: \code{afex_options(include_aov = FALSE)}
  
  The id variable and variables entered as within-subjects (i.e.,
  repeated-measures) factors are silently converted to factors. Levels of
  within-subject factors are converted to valid variable names using
  \code{\link{make.names}(...,unique=TRUE)}. Unused factor levels are
  silently dropped on all variables.
  
  Contrasts attached to a factor as an attribute are probably not preserved
  and not supported.
  
  The workhorse is \code{aov_car}. \code{aov_4} and \code{aov_ez} only
  construe and pass an appropriate formula to \code{aov_car}. Use
  \code{print.formula = TRUE} to view this formula.
  
  In contrast to \code{\link{aov}} \code{aov_car} assumes that all factors to
  the right of \code{/} in the \code{Error} term are belonging together.
  Consequently, \code{Error(id/(a*b))} and \code{Error(id/a*b)} are identical
  (which is not true for \code{\link{aov}}).

  A_B_pre = c(rep(0, 6), 0, -1, 1),  # A versus B for pretest
  A_B_comb = c(-0.5, 0.5, 0, -0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0), # A vs. B for post and follow-up combined
  effect_post = c(0, 0, 0, -1, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0), # control versus A&B post
  effect_fup = c(-1, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), # control versus A&B follow-up
  effect_comb = c(-0.5, 0.25, 0.25, -0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, 0) # control versus A&B combined
)

# 4. test contrasts on reference grid:
contrast(r1, c1)

# same as before, but using Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple testing:
contrast(r1, c1, adjust = "holm")

# 2. (alternative): all pairwise comparisons of treatment:
emmeans(a1, "treatment", contr = "pairwise", model = "multivariate")

## set multivariate models globally:
# afex_options(emmeans_model = "multivariate")
