Changes in afex Version 1.2-x (2022-10-30)

Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
 o   Multiple geoms for data in the background can now be passed to afex_plot() as a list. Likewise, for each geom, a separate list of additional arguments can be passed as a list of lists to data_arg.
 o   afex_plot() gets a new argument, data_color with default "darkgrey". Like data_alpha for alpha, data_color sets the colour for the geom (or now geoms) used to plot the data in the background. 
 o   Both data_color and data_alpha can now be set to NULL, in which case they will not be set but should be set by the user through data_arg.

Bugfixes
 o   Data in mixed() output is shown nicer (#113)
 o   afex_plot() should now work with factor_levels arguments even if corresponding variable is not a factor in the data.
 o   Resaved plots for new version of ggbeeswarm (#117).

Changes in afex Version 1.1-x (2022-03-30)

Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
 o   Fitting messages for mixed() are now only shown per default in interactive mode, thanks to Marius Barth (#111).
 o   Nicer error message about missing variables for ANOVAs.
 o   Removed check_contrasts() argument for ANOVAs, which did not work as described for designs with repeated-measures factors: https://github.com/singmann/afex/issues/109

Bugfixes
 o   Fixed overzealous data completeness check introduced in version 1.0 in aov_car() which prevented ANOVAs with additive factors and no cross over data from working.
 o   mixed(..., method = "LRT") and similar nested methods should work with empty factor levels: https://github.com/singmann/afex/issues/96
 
Changes in afex Version 1.0-x (2021-07-02)

Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
 o   ANOVA objects do not by default contain the aov slot any more
 o   emmeans() for ANOVA now uses multivariate model as default
 o   Default p-value method for mixed() is now Satterthwaite: method = "S"
 o   New data set, Urry et al. (2021, Psych Science): laptop_urry

The following changes are thanks to Mattan S. Ben-Shachar:
 o   Added new vignette: "Testing the Assumptions of ANOVAs"
 o   Added predict() method for afex_aov objects.
 o   Deprecated functions test_levene() and test_sphercitiy(), which are now part of the performance package as performance::check_homogeneity() and performance::check_sphericity(), respectively.

Bugfixes
 o   All vignettes should run without suggested packages present.
 o   Added ez to suggests, to avoid NOTE on CRAN solaris.
